Excluding livestock access to farm dams reduces methane emissions and boosts water quality

Instructions:

The .zip file contains three folders:

1. Data (where all data are--GHG_Data)
2. R code (all analyses in R)
3. Results (plots and tables from R)

For the R code, open the script “ANALYSES_MN.R” with statistical software R. Within the script file: (1) check that all packages are installed in the computer (otherwise install before running the script), and (2) set the directory accordingly on your computer. After having done that, everything else should work by simply running the R script. All results including statistics, plots and imgages are saved in the directory specified. The file is designed to run on HP computer.
